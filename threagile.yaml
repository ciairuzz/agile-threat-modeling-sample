# NOTE:
#
# For a perfect editing experience within your IDE of choice you can easily
# get model syntax validation and autocompletion (very handy for enum values)
# as well as live templates: Just import the schema.json into your IDE and assign
# it as "schema" to each Threagile YAML file. Also try to import individual parts
# from the live-templates.txt file into your IDE as live editing templates.
#
# You might also want to try the REST API when running in server mode...


# This is only a stub for simple quick editing and is not complete.
# For a complete usable example model see the "-create-example-model" option.

questions: # simply use "" as answer to signal "unanswered"
  Some question without an answer?: ""
  Some question with an answer?: >
    Some answer



abuse_cases:
  Abuse Case 1: >
    A malicious user can impersonate somebody else and say bad words to the security architect
  Abuse Case 2: >
    A malicious external user can attempt exfiltrating greetings meant for the security architect eyes only
  Abuse Case 3: >
    A malicious admin with access to the database can attempt modifying the greeting value



security_requirements:
  Input Validation: Strict input validation is required to reduce the overall attack surface.
  Authentication: Authentication is required to avoid unpleasant greetings from trolls.


# Tags can be used for anything, it's just a tag. Also risk rules can act based on tags if you like.
# Tags can be used for example to name the products used (which is more concrete than the technology types that only specify the type)

# NOTE:
# For risk tracking each risk-id needs to be defined (the string with the @ sign in it). These unique risk IDs
# are visible in the PDF report (the small grey string under each risk), the Excel (column "ID"), as well as the JSON responses.
# Some risk IDs have only one @ sign in them, while others multiple. The idea is to allow for unique but still speaking IDs.
# Therefore each risk instance creates its individual ID by taking all affected elements causing the risk to be within an @-delimited part.
# Using wildcards (the * sign) for parts delimited by @ signs allows to handle groups of certain risks at once. Best is to lookup the IDs
# to use in the created Excel file. Alternatively a model macro "seed-risk-tracking" is available that helps in initially
# seeding the risk tracking part here based on already identified and not yet handled risks.
