    Abuse Case 1: |
        A malicious user can impersonate somebody else and say bad words to the security architect
    Abuse Case 2: |
        A malicious external user can attempt exfiltrating greetings meant for the security architect eyes only
    Abuse Case 3: |
        A malicious admin with access to the database can attempt modifying the greeting value
security_requirements:
